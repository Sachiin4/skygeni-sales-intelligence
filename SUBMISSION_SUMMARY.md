# SkyGeni Sales Intelligence – Submission Summary

## Objective

Investigate declining win rates despite a healthy pipeline and design a lightweight decision intelligence system to help sales leadership identify risks and improve revenue outcomes.

---

## What Was Built

- Exploratory analysis of sales pipeline behavior
- Win rate driver analysis using an interpretable model
- Deal-level win probability scoring
- High-risk deal detection
- Pipeline health metric using probability-weighted revenue
- Automated CRO insight generation

---

## Key Business Findings

- Largest leakage occurs at the **Qualified stage**
- Revenue is highly concentrated in top 20% deals
- Several deals show <40% win probability and require early intervention
- Pipeline health suggests only ~47% of value is realistically convertible

---

## Actionable Recommendations

1. Tighten qualification criteria
2. Review low-probability deals weekly
3. Focus on referral and late-stage opportunities
4. Monitor top-value deals closely
5. Track probability-weighted pipeline health

## Business Impact

This system provides CRO-level visibility into:

- Where deals are being lost
- Which segments require attention
- Which actions can improve conversion and revenue predictability
